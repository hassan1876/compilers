## About COOL

[COOL](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/) is a small, object-oriented programming language commonly used in compiler design courses to teach concepts like:  
- Lexical Analysis  
- Parsing  
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)  

COOL is designed to be simple, yet it includes essential programming constructs such as classes, methods and conditionals.
